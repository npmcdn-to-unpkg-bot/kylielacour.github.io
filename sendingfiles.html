                    <h1 class="title">how to send files to your printer so they don't hate you</h1>
                    <p class="subhead">The printer-designer relationship is a beautiful, fragile flower. Follow these steps to make your files squeaky clean so you and your printer can live happily ever after.</p>
                    
                    <hr class="line">
                    
                    <a name="1"></a>
                    
                    <h3 class="subhead">
                        <span class="number">1</span> clean it up</h3>
                    <p>The first thing you want to do is quickly clean up your files. Make sure to delete any links or bits of text that are spread around on the pasteboard. Delete working layers that are no longer necessary. Delete unused master pages, paragraph and character styles, and colors in your swatches palette. Make sure you set your bleed right!</p>
                    <p>
                        Here's a cheat sheet of things to delete:<br><br>
                    &bull; delete anything outside the art board<br>
                    &bull; delete unused layers<br>
                    &bull; delete unused master pages<br>
                    &bull; delete unused paragraph styles<br>
                    &bull; delete unused character styles<br>
                    &bull; delete unused colors<br>
                    </p>
                <p>
                Ideally you'd be deleting everything as you go. I know I end up with <em>tons</em> of unused paragraph and character styles, and it's hard to figure out what's to keep and what can go! Keep this all in mind while you design!</p>
                    
                    <a name="2"></a>
                    
                    <h3 class="subhead">
                        <span class="number">2</span> show me your package</h3>
                    
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="sendingfiles_img/package1.png" alt="">
                    
                    <p>To send all of the files associated with a design, use the "Package" feature from the File Menu of InDesign or Illustrator. Be sure to send the fonts in the package too!
                        
                        <br><br>Printers really, really prefer to get packaged InDesign files. Changes are often made after the first round of proofs and they can easily modify page layout files, so if it's a tiny change, you don't have to do it yourself.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="sendingfiles_img/package2.png" alt="">
                    <p>If you are more comfortable sending a PDF, the best export settings are <strong>PDF/X-4 with trim marks and at least .125 bleed.</strong>
                    </p>
                    
                    <a name="3"></a>
                    
                    <h3 class="subhead">
                        <span class="number">3</span> no security</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                    Printer's imposition software may reject a PDF with security settings, even in the file does not require a password. Avoid any security restrictions on PDFs intended for print. Security is not supported in PDF/X compliant files for this reason.
                        <br><br>
                        Send a hard copy and/or a PDF for the printer to check their proof against. Make a folding dummy if applicable.
                        <br><br>
                        For complex revisions, you'll want to ask the printer for their file to modify, rather than your own. They've likely already made a bunch of prepress formating changes and it's best to not make them do it again. Trust me, they're more than happy to share their files with you!
                        <br><br>
                        When sending back revised files, mark the changes on the proof, change the InDesign file name to BlankBlank_REV, and highlight new or changed links on the directory.
                    </p>
                    
                    <a name="4"></a>
                    
                    <h3 class="subhead">
                        <span class="number">4</span> zip it up</h3>
                    
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="sendingfiles_img/Screen%20Shot%202016-06-06%20at%209.15.35%20PM.png" alt="">
                    
                    <p>
                        Always zip files before emailing or FTPing them. The Mac's built-in OSX zip utility works very well (control-click or right-click on a file or folder and select "Create archive..." or "Compress..."). This allow you to send entire folder, rather than file by file. It also quite literally "compresses" the files, so they're a bit smaller to send!
